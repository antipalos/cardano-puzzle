Welcome to an archive of crypto-puzzlers, potentially related somehow to [Cardano](https://cardanowiki.info) project, and rewarded with ADA cryptocurrency.

### Rules

As with many other crypto-puzzlers - each puzzle hides a key that opens you full access to a wallet with the prize. Therefore you don't need anyone to check if your solution is correct or not - you either gain full access to the prize, or the solution is wrong.

Each puzzler has link to an explorer website attached, demonstrating the reward address from the hidden wallet. This means that you can at any point check whether the puzzler is still active, meaning that wallet still has some non-zero balance.

When puzzler is solved and wallet is emptied - the detailed solution will be posted, but it still might be interesting for someone to try and solve the puzzler even with no monetary prize, which is why solution will be posted on a separate page, and linked from the puzzle page.
